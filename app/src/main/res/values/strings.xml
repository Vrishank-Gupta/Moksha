    <string name="impressum">Providing free education for underprivileged children near Pragati Maidan at Janta Camp, Bhairon Marg, New Delhi, India</string>
    <string name="story">Sabki Pathshala is a voluntary initiative started by Ms. Neetu Singh, who having struggled to study under extreme financial and social difficulties herself, empathises with children facing similar challenges.
Circumstances of these children force them to deviate from the path of education and find ways of earning quick money by doing odd jobs, begging and even crime.
But at Sabki Pathshala, the aim is to help these children educate themselves by providing classes in their vicinity and engaging them in not just books but in arts and cultural activities for their holistic development as individuals.
Years of efforts put in by Ms. Neetu Singh have finally started bearing fruit and she has also been awarded by platforms such as The Rotary Club, Delhi Commission of Women etc and media coverage, for her efforts.
Support this movement for a new generation of bright minds who need us to break free from their circumstances. Contact us for more information on how you can support.

    <string name="descr">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry\'s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</string>

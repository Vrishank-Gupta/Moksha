This Repository Contains Source Code for Hackeam Hackathon by Teamc18.
Team Bitsplease Went to Educational Trek at Sab Ki Pathshala, Pragati Maidan, Delhi.
Sab Ki Pathshala is a slum school managed by a single Teacher Ms. Neetu Singh. The School lacks basic necessities such as books,desks,shelves due to shoratage of funds. They lacked access to quality education.

Following Hon'ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi, this app has an integrated feature of login via scanning Adhar Card with QR code and hence as secure as possible! Moreover, user can also via his/her Google Account.

Through this app, we have created a platform for the students to sell their products (which they make during their free times or during art and craft teaching like Stone Painting, Mats,Bags,Diyas etc) and raise some funds for their betterment.

This app also provides a portal for general users to help these children by donating some items which the school lacks such as furnitures, stationery items etc. Donations can also be in the form of real money which would surely help in betterment of these students.

Through this app, children get access to quality education through video lectures on **YouTube**, programming tutorials on **GeeksForGeeks**, practice questions on **HackerEarth** (for 11th and 12th class students).

This app has an integrated feature of live chatting with Sab Ki Pathshala representatives with strong encryption of Google Firebase at it's back.

When the team visited Sab Ki Pathshala we came to know that the school had their own facebook page. Ms Neetu singh the school Head had requested us to look into this matter. Therefore we have incorporated a feature in our app to open the facebook page of the school and hence increase its reach.
